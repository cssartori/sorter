# Sorter

This program implements a Graphical User Interface to compare several sorting methods. The user may analyze algorithms through three different criteria: total execution time, total number of swaps, and total number of comparisons. The sorting algorithms available are:

1. Bubble Sort;
2. Insertion Sort;
3. Selection Sort;
4. Quick Sort;
5. Heap Sort;
6. Merge Sort;
7. Counting Sort;

After the calculations are done, a graphic is presented to better compare the results. One can also save the detailed results to a text file.

## Implementation

Implemented in C++11, using Qt Creator to generate the GUI. The graphic plotting tool used is the [QCustomPlot](http://www.qcustomplot.com/)). It can be compiled both in Windows and Linux using Qt (> 4.0) tools.

## About

Done for the `INF01124 - Data Search and Classification` discipline, 2013, at UFRGS.
