# **Sorter** #

This program implements several sorting methods, allowing the user to compare two different algorithms through three criteria: execution time, number of swaps and number of comparisons. The methods available are:

1. Bubble Sort;
2. Insertion Sort;
3. Selection Sort;
4. Quick Sort;
5. Heap Sort;
6. Merge Sort;
7. Counting Sort;

After the calculations are done, a graphic is presented to better compare the results. One can also save the detailed results to a text file.
